---B. Runner and Customer Experience---

-- 1.How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts 2021-01-01)
SELECT
	DATE_PART('week',registration_date) AS week,
  COUNT(runner_id) AS runners_signed_up
FROM pizza_runner.runners
GROUP BY week;

-- 2.What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?
SELECT AVG(time_to_pickup) AS avg_time_to_pickup
FROM
	(SELECT
     	c.order_id,
     	ABS(DATE_PART('minute',c.order_time-r.pickup_time)) AS time_to_pickup
     FROM customer_orders_temp AS c
     JOIN runner_orders_temp AS r
     	ON c.order_id=r.order_id
     WHERE r.distance!=0) AS pickup_table;

-- 3.Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?
SELECT
	number_pizzas,
	AVG(prepare_time) AS time_to_prepare
FROM
	(SELECT
     	c.order_id,
     	COUNT(c.order_id) AS number_pizzas,

   FROM customer_orders_temp AS c
   JOIN runner_orders_temp AS r
     	ON c.order_id=r.order_id
   WHERE r.pickup_time IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY c.order_id, c.order_time, r.pickup_time ) AS prepare_time_table
GROUP BY number_pizzas
ORDER BY number_pizzas;

-- 4.What was the average distance travelled for each customer?
SELECT
	c.customer_id,
  AVG(distance) AS avg_distance
FROM customer_orders_temp AS c
JOIN runner_orders_temp AS r
	ON c.order_id=r.order_id
WHERE distance!=0
GROUP BY c.customer_id
ORDER BY c.customer_id;
            
-- 5.What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?
SELECT
	MAX(prepare_time)-MIN(prepare_time) AS delivery_times
FROM
	(SELECT
     	c.order_id,
     	ABS(DATE_PART('minute',r.pickup_time-c.order_time)) AS prepare_time
   FROM customer_orders_temp AS c
   JOIN runner_orders_temp AS r
     	ON c.order_id=r.order_id
   WHERE r.pickup_time IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY c.order_id, c.order_time, r.pickup_time ) AS prepare_time_table;

-- 6.What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?
SELECT
	  r.runner_id,
    c.customer_id,
    r.order_id,
    COUNT(pizza_id) AS pizza_count,
    r.distance,
    r.duration/60 AS duration_hour,
    r.distance/r.duration*60 AS avg_speed
FROM customer_orders_temp AS c
JOIN runner_orders_temp AS r
  ON c.order_id=r.order_id
WHERE r.duration!=0 OR r.duration!=0
GROUP BY r.runner_id,c.customer_id,r.order_id,r.distance,r.duration
ORDER BY r.runner_id, avg_speed;

-- 7.What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?
SELECT
	runner_id,
	ROUND(100*SUM(CASE WHEN distance=0 THEN 0 ELSE 1 END)/COUNT(order_id),2)AS perc_successful
FROM runner_orders_temp
GROUP BY runner_id
ORDER BY runner_id;
