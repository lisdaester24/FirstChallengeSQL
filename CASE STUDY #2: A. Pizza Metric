-- 5.How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?
SELECT
	customer_id,
  SUM(CASE WHEN pizza_id=1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS meatlovers_ordered,

FROM customer_orders_temp
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id;

-- 6.What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order?
SELECT MAX(number_per_order) AS max_per_order
FROM
	(SELECT
     	c.order_id,
     	COUNT(c.pizza_id) AS number_per_order
    FROM customer_orders_temp AS c
    JOIN runner_orders_temp AS r
		  ON c.order_id=r.order_id

-- 7.For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?
SELECT
	c.customer_id,
  SUM(CASE WHEN exclusions='' AND extras='' THEN 0 ELSE 1 END) AS at_least_1_change,

FROM customer_orders_temp AS c
JOIN runner_orders_temp AS r
	ON c.order_id=r.order_id
WHERE r.distance!=0
GROUP BY c.customer_id
ORDER BY c.customer_id;
        
-- 8.How many pizzas were delivered that had both exclusions and extras?
SELECT
    SUM(CASE WHEN exclusions !='' AND extras !='' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS exclusions_extras
FROM customer_orders_temp AS c
JOIN runner_orders_temp AS r
	ON c.order_id=r.order_id
WHERE r.distance!=0;

-- 9.What was the total volume of pizzas ordered for each hour of the day?
SELECT 
  EXTRACT(HOUR FROM (order_time)) AS hour_of_day, 
  COUNT(order_id) AS pizza_count
FROM customer_orders_temp

ORDER BY hour_of_day;
                     
-- 10.What was the volume of orders for each day of the week?
SELECT 
  EXTRACT(DAY FROM (order_time)) AS day_of_week,
